This docker image can only combine test results from multiple test runs in a single report.
It offers the same functionality as the `htmlReportIndexGenerator.sh` present in the images to run tests.

This image is very small and intended to be used in situations where one only needs to combine reports and 
the (larger) images to run tests have not been downloaded yet.
