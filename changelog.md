Release ${VERSION} of the project contains FitNesse ${FITNESSE_VERSION} and Selenium ${SELENIUM_VERSION}.

To get started by running some sample tests (if you have a Java runtime installed): just download the standalone.zip, extract it and run it (using '`java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar -p 9090`', or on Windows just double clicking the jar to run the application on port `80` instead of `9090`) from the directory where the 'standalone.zip' was extracted and open a browser to `http://localhost:9090/HsacExamples`.

> Please note: please extract the zip to a location without spaces in its own name or in the names of its parents.

How to create your own test project using this FitNesse setup, see https://github.com/fhoeben/hsac-fitnesse-fixtures#to-create-your-own-test-project and https://github.com/fhoeben/hsac-fitnesse-fixtures/wiki/Installation-Guide

To incorporate the fixtures in an existing FitNesse project you can also get it from Maven Central

```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>nl.hsac</groupId>
            <artifactId>hsac-fitnesse-fixtures</artifactId>
            <version>${VERSION}</version>
        </dependency>
```

An example of Maven based project using this baseline can be found at: https://github.com/fhoeben/sample-fitnesse-project.

When upgrading from an older version, ensure all Selenium webdrivers are stopped and delete the 'wiki/plugins' and 'wiki/webdrivers' folders to remove old versions of the packaged plugins/webdrivers. When using the sample project: follow the instructions at https://github.com/fhoeben/sample-fitnesse-project#upgrading.
