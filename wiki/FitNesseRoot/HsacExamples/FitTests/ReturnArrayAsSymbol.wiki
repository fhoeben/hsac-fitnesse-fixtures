Help: Return array in as symbol

!1 Return array as symbol
Sometimes it might be desirable to be able to store an array returned from a test in a symbol and to compare entries of that array with values in later tests.

To use this feature, implement a method in your fixture that returns a String array. For an example, see the asArray method of the !-CompareValuesFixture-! class. To use an array entry in comparison with an expected output, add a $ to the end of the columnname (see [[Symbol and array comparison][ArraysAndSymbolsComparison]]).

The array is 1 based instead of 0 based.

!2 Demonstration

First store value1 and value2 as array in symbol myArray.
|!-CompareValues-!      |
|value1|value2|=asArray?|
|1     |2     |myArray  |

Compare first and second entry from array with new value1.
|!-CompareValues-!|
|value1 |value1?$ |
|1      |myArray.1|
|2      |myArray.2|
Tip: to see how the output is in case of a failure, change value1.
