Help: Library fixture to add/subtract timeunits from a given date or time
Test
---
We can calculate times relative to a given date using:

{{{| add | x | [timeunits] to | [given date] |}}}

Suppported timeunits are: ''seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years''
''x'' can be a negative number to subtract instead of add.
The fixture needs to be initialized with the date format used in your test.
