Help: Utility fixture to work with files

The !-FileFixture-! allows file manipulation, either in the [[wiki's files section][.FitNesse.FullReferenceGuide.UserGuide.FitNesseWiki.FilesSection]], or on the file system.
Files can be generated using Freemarker templates, directly from strings or by copying files. 
File's content and size may be retrieved.
Filenames may be manipulated.

#!define DIR {/Users/fried/dev/github-hsac-fitnesse-fixtures/wiki/FitNesseRoot/files}
!define DIR {.}

!define LIST_CONTENT {!-001
002

Table below shows how we can use a list of non-reusable data from a file:

|script                                                             |

|create       |list.txt            |containing    |${LIST_CONTENT}  |
|show         |text in             |list.txt                        |
|check        |take first line from|list.txt      |001              |
|show         |text in             |list.txt                        |
|check        |take first line from|list.txt      |002              |

|show         |text in             |list.txt                        |
