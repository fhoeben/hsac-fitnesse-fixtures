!2 Https without certificate verification

Performs HTTPS GET on domains that would normally throw an exception because of bad SSL certificates.

'''''Use at your own risk, this makes https potentially as unsafe as http!'''''

|script  |http test                         |
|disable SSL verification                   |
|get from|https://expired.badssl.com/       |
|get from|https://wrong.host.badssl.com/    |
|get from|https://self-signed.badssl.com/   |
|get from|https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/|

Note that 'disable SSL verification' lasts for the rest of the test run, or until you call 'enable SSL verification', like this:

|script    |http test   |
|enable SSL verification|
