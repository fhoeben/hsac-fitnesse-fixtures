!2 Http GET with gzip compression support

Performs HTTP GET with gzip compression support.

|script|http client setup  |
|enable content compression|
|configure http test       |

|script  |http test                                            |
|get from|http://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/activities/1|
|show    |response                                             |

Note that the Content-Encoding header is automatically removed after the content is decoded, so |show|response header|Content-Encoding| will show null regardless of actual encoding. Tools like Wireshark will allow you to see if the content was really sent gzipped.

Note that 'enable content compression' lasts for the rest of the test run, so we need to reset after test.
This is achieved in this suite's TearDown.
