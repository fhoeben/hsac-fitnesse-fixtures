Test
Help: Https GET without certificate verification
---

Performs HTTPS GET on domains that would normally throw an exception because of bad SSL certificates.

'''''Use at your own risk, this makes https potentially as unsafe as http!'''''

|get from                                   |https://wrong.host.badssl.com/    |
|get from                                   |https://self-signed.badssl.com/   |
|get from                                   |https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/|

Note that 'disable SSL verification' lasts for the rest of the test run, so we need to reset after test.
This is achieved in this suite's TearDown.
