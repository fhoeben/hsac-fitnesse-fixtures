Changing http test's HTTP handling can be done via 'http client setup'.
But one should always be careful that changing the client handling lasts until you change it again, if it is not
changed explicitly the changes will last for all subsequent tests until the end of the run. To prevent such side effects
this suite uses a >SuiteSetUp to store the original client and >TearDown to restore this after each test.

>HttpCompressionViaSetup shows an example GET request with gzip compression support.
>HttpsWithoutCertificateVerificationViaSetup shows example GET requests without SSL certificate verification

Other configuration changes that can be achieved are explicitly setting a trust store determining which certificates are trusted
and sending specific client certificates with requests (to achieve two sided authentication).
