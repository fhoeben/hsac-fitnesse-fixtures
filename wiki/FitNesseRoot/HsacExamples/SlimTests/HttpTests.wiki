Help: Shows example usage of (Json/Xml)HttpTest fixture.
Suite
---
!-(Json/Xml)HttpTest-! defines a basic language (a DSL of sorts) to interact with a website via HTTP requests (allowing SOAP (and REST) services to be tested). The XML subclass adds functionality to perform checks using XPath expressions on the response received. The !-JsonHttpTest-! subclass adds functionality to perform checks using !-JsonPath-! expressions.
This basic functionality will suffice for many tests, but can be extended by creating a custom subclass.

The tests in this suite show example usage of this fixture:
>HttpGetTest shows an example GET request, specifying parameters in the query string.
>HttpPost1Test sends a POST request to a SOAP service, also adding an HTTP header.
The >HttpPost2UsingScenarioTest makes multiple SOAP calls to a service, where scenario parameters are used to change an input variable's value for each call.
>HttpPostFileTest sends a binary file.
>HttpPost3UsingFreemarkerTemplateTest shows the usage of a [[Freemarker][http://freemarker.org]] template to define the content of a SOAP request. This allows for dynamic request structure.
>JsonHttpTest shows examples with GET, POST, AND PUT, using [[!-JsonPath-!][http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/]] to perform checks on the response.
>HttpGetFollowRedirectTest shows checking the redirect sent by a server instead of following it.
>HttpCookieHandling shows how cookie handling can be configured.
>HttpHeadTest shows an example HEAD request, retrieving only response status and headers.
>CustomHttpConfig shows some examples how to customize the request handling (e.g. enable gzip compression, configuring client certifcates or disable SSL verification).
