This set up page is executed once, before any tests in this suite.
In it we configure which Java packages contain the logic for our fixtures, which browser we want to use for Selenium tests and we start this browser.
This means we do not have to do this in every test, which means easier maintenance and better performance.

Stopping the browser is done in SuiteTearDown, which is done after all tests in this suite are completed.

The Selenium configuration below uses lines starting with ''|note'' to have configuration values present that are not currently used.
This allows us to switch to another browser by just adding ''|note'' to one line and removing it from another, instead of typing the entire line.

Furthermore this configuration is prepared for both running the browser on the same (development) machine running Fitnesse (with ''start driver for''), as remotely on a node in a Selenium Grid (with ''connect to driver for''). 
The latter allows tests to be executed on different operating systems. This is also very useful to run tests as part of a continuous integration server (i.e. build server), when no browsers are installed on the server running the tests.
