!-BrowserTest-! defines a language (a DSL of sorts) to interact with a website via a browser. Normally a heuristic is used to find elements using end-user terms, leading to readable wiki pages describing tests, robust to technical changes in the site's HTML. But this heuristic may be bypassed in favor of [[technical selectors][>TechnicalSelectors]] to specify which element is meant. Furthermore !-BrowserTest-! retries finding elements (for a configurable time) if it cannot locate the immediately. This allows tests of dynamic web pages (where the page content is updated asynchronous using !-JavaScript-!) or using browsers where Selenium is not always able to determine whether a page load is complete (e.g. Safari).

The language supported by !-BrowserTest-! is defined by its public methods, which can be used in combination with Slim's standard script verbs (e.g. check, ensure, reject, show).
!-BrowserTest-!'s language will suffice for many tests, but can be extended by creating a custom subclass. 
A specific subclass (!-NgBrowserTest-!) is included to test [[!-AngularJs-!][https://angularjs.org]] sites. This class has functionality to find elements based on ‘models’, ‘bindings’ and ‘repeaters’ (borrowed from [[Protractor][http://angular.github.io/protractor/]]).

The tests in this suite show example usage of this fixture:
>ScriptTest shows the basic functionality of !-BrowserTest-! to test websites.
>ScenarioTest takes this to the next level by using a parameterized script (i.e. scenario).
The >TableTemplateTest simplifies the parameterization of the script.
>CustomFixtureTest shows the usage of a custom subclass of !-BrowserTest-! to make test content more descriptive by encapsulating knowledge of the site's HTML in Java code.
>StoryboardTest shows a test where a screenshot is taken after each action. This is then combined with a scenario in >TemplateStoryboardTest.
>ResizeTest shows some manipulation of the browser window.
>CheckboxRadiobuttonTest shows how to check values of radio buttons and checkboxes.
>AngularJsCalculatorTest test an [[!-AngularJs-!][https://angularjs.org]] application using !-NgBrowserTest-! to select elements by model, binding and repeater. >AngularUiSelectTest show a test interacting with [[!-AngularJs-! ui-select][https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-select]].
>HeuristicVsTechnicalSelectors contains a single test in two versions: using the heuristics and using technical selectors to give some more understanding of the difference between the two.

!3 !-BrowserTest-!

The main commands/keywords (i.e. public methods) offered by !-nl.hsac.fitnesse.fixture.slim.web.BrowserTest-! are listed below.
The heuristic to find places tries a number of translations of end user terms to Selenium 'find' commands (e.g. is a full or partial label given, a link's or button's text, a placeholder). The first find that results in an element on the page is used by !-BrowserTest-!.

!3 !-NgBrowserTest-!

!-nl.hsac.fitnesse.fixture.slim.web.NgBrowserTest-! ensures Angular is finished processing the page before trying to find elements or interact with them. Furthermore it adds finding elements by based on Angular bindings and models to the heuristic. Finally it adds some commands/keywords to !-BrowserTest's-!, the main ones are listed below.
