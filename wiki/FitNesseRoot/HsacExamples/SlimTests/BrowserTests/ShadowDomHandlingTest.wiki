!1 Website testing using !-BrowserTest-!

On this page we will see the basic usage of the [[shadow automation selenium plugin][https://github.com/sukgu/shadow-automation-selenium]] by [[sukgu][https://github.com/sukgu/shadow-automation-selenium/commits?author=sukgu]] to
find elements that are insade a shadow DOM. 

The plugin only uses technical selectors to find elements, to be specific you need to specify the CSS selector of the element you want to find/click.
Below is a simple example using the shadow automation plugin. The plugin is integrated into fitnesse and uses the methods of BrowserTest.
