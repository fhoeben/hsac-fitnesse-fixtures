#2 Selenium 4 and DevTools

Selenium 4 provides access to Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDT) on Chromium based browsers (Chromium, Chrome, Edge).
The necessary bindings are version-specific and thus need to be implemented correctly for the browser you use.

In order to use these functions, you can create your own extension on Browser Test  and implement what you need. For convenience, sample implementations are provided (against CDP v97) in !style_code[nl.hsac.fitnesse.sample.DevToolsBrowserTest]

Using that class, the examples in this folder can be tried out and serve as a reference to roll yur own project specific devtools enabled browser test fixture.
